<h2>:eye_speech_bubble: About me</h2>
<p>As a positive-thinking and detail-oriented individual with a background in chemistry, I am seeking a challenging role as a software tester where I can apply my analytical and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>I possess a combination of analytical and communication skills that make me an effective software tester. As a former chemist, I have honed my ability to be highly organized and attentive to detail. Additionally, my outgoing personality enables me to communicate effectively with team members and resolve issues efficiently.</p>
<p>Although I have not had the opportunity to work in software testing before, I am highly motivated and enthusiastic about gaining hands-on experience in the field. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world testing scenarios and learn from experienced professionals in the industry. </p>
<p>My current career goal is to become a mid-level software tester within the next two years. I am eager to gain hands-on experience in software testing and apply my skills to testing operational products.</p>
